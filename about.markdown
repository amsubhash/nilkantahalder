My name is Nilkanta Halder, I live in a small village called Pratappur which is in Durgapur, West Bengal, India.

In my village the main occupation of maximum peoples is **Farming** so from my childhood I am very much involved in farming,
and with that only I have grown a keen interest in gardening.
Currently I am also a secretary at an N.G.O, due to which I am able to get in contact with some of experts in the field of agricultural development, and gain experiences from them.
So with the help of my personal experience and the technique I learned from the expert I am able to flourish my skills in gardening.

I have an Youtube channel [**https://www.youtube.com/nilkantahalder**][youtube-link] where I post regular video regarding my work.

Beside gardening I do many types of work like
- Soil less farming
- Making simple tree pot
- Roof top gardening
- Container gardening
- Bonsai
- Organic fertilizer
